🧬 What is STRING?
STRING is a database and web resource that provides:

Known and predicted protein-protein interactions

Interaction networks from experimental data, databases, co-expression, and text mining

Support for many organisms and custom protein lists

🛠️ Getting Started
1. Visit STRING
Go to: https://string-db.org

2. Input Options
You can search by:

Single protein name (e.g. WRKY33)

List of gene/protein names

Upload files with identifiers (e.g. FASTA, CSV)

Select:

Organism (e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana, Homo sapiens, or your organism of interest)

🧾 Using STRING: Step-by-Step
🟦 A. Single Gene/Protein Search
Go to the homepage.

In the Search box, type a gene or protein (e.g., WRKY33) and select the correct organism.

Click “Search”.

You'll see a network of interactors based on:

Experimental evidence

Predicted associations

Text mining

Databases

🟨 B. Multiple Protein List
Click “Multiple proteins” on the homepage.

Paste your list of protein names or identifiers.

Choose the correct organism.

Click “Continue”.

STRING will build a network showing connections between your input proteins and their partners.

🟥 C. Upload Your Data
Click on the “Upload” tab.

Provide a file with your gene/protein list.

Choose your organism and settings.

STRING will generate the interaction network.

🔍 Customization Options
Confidence score threshold: Adjust interaction strength (default is 0.4 = medium confidence).

Network depth: Limit or expand interactions (e.g., first shell, second shell).

View options: You can color by interaction source, structure, or evidence type.

💾 Export & Download
You can download:

Images (PNG, SVG)

Network tables

Protein interaction data

Cytoscape-compatible files for further analysis

🧪 Advanced Tools
Enrichment Analysis: Shows GO terms, KEGG pathways, and domains enriched in your list.

Cluster Analysis: Finds functionally connected groups.

Cytoscape Plugin: Use STRING networks within Cytoscape.

🧠 Tips
Use official gene/protein symbols for your organism.

You can use UniProt IDs, NCBI gene symbols, or ENSEMBL IDs.

For custom organisms or unpublished data, use user-uploaded networks with caution.
