üíæ Transferring Files to HPC
To transfer a folder from your local computer to the HPC:

scp -r your_folder_name hadi@cherry-creek.nscee.edu:/path/to/destination_folder
Replace your_folder_name with the folder you want to copy.

Replace /path/to/destination_folder with the desired path on the HPC.

üß∞ Job Submission (PBS)
Jobs on the HPC are submitted using PBS job scripts. Here's how:

1. Create a PBS Script
Create a file called job.pbs with the following format:

#!/bin/bash
#PBS -N my_job_name
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=4
#PBS -l walltime=02:00:00
#PBS -l mem=16gb
#PBS -q batch
#PBS -o output.log
#PBS -e error.log
#PBS -V

cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
module load your_module
./your_script.sh
2. Submit the Job
Once your .pbs script is ready, submit it using:

qsub job.pbs
3. Check Job Status
To check the status of your submitted jobs:


qstat -u your_username
4. Cancel a Job
To cancel a job:


qdel job_id
